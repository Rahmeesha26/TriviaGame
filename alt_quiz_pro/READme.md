# Let's Get Smart but Make it Fun!

## Getting Started
+ First create your question data and figure out how to pull with an AJAX Request
+ Create the basic game functionality in your app
+ Style after all the functionality is complete
+ Don't hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short-term problems.
+ Read the documentation for whatever technologies you use. Most of the time — but not always — there is a tutorial you can follow, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer.
+ Write pseudocode before you write any JavaScript code. Planning out and thinking through interactions for a website is an important step that will save you time and effort when you start actually coding.
+ Do not simply copy and paste code that you find online! It is OK (and highly encouraged) to use resources like Stack Overflow when thinking through interactions, but use these sites as a guide and then write the code on your own.
